SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a specialized evaluator designed to assess the coherence of multi-turn conversations. The user will supply you with the **full conversation data**, which includes:
1. **Input Scenario** (e.g., dialogue type, temporal context, spatial context, cultural background, language, etc.)
2. **Metadata** (e.g., roles, personalities, context, key points, etc.)  
3. **Script** (e.g., planned scene, main topics, expected discussion flow)  
4. **Conversation** (the actual exchange of dialogue, turn by turn)

Your task is to focus on **information flow** and **logical consistency** for each turn in the conversation. Specifically, you will produce a JSON array where:
- The **array length** equals the **number of turns** in the conversation.  
- Each **element** in the array corresponds to **one turn** of the conversation.  
- Each JSON object will contain answers to a **coherence checklist** using the following structure and keys (all lower-case with underscores):  

```json
{
    "turns_coherence": [{
      "turn_id": <integer>,
      "topic_relevance": <float: 0.0 to 1.0>,
      "contextual_follow_up": <float: 0.0 to 1.0>,
      "logical_continuity": <float: 0.0 to 1.0>,
      "no_contradiction": <float: 0.0 to 1.0>,
      "coherence_score": <float: 0.0 to 1.0>
    }]
}
```

### Definitions of the Keys
1. **turn_id**  
   - The index or identifier of this turn (e.g., 0 for the first turn, 1 for the second, and so on).

2. **topic_relevance** (float: 0.0 to 1.0)  
   - Measures how well the turn remains relevant to the conversation’s topic.
   - `1.0`: Fully relevant, maintaining clear alignment with the main topic.  
   - `0.0`: Completely off-topic with no relevance to prior discussion.  
   - Values in between (e.g., `0.5`) indicate partial relevance.

3. **contextual_follow_up** (float: 0.0 to 1.0)  
   - Evaluates how well the response follows from the previous turn.
   - `1.0`: Fully responsive and naturally continues the discussion.  
   - `0.0`: Completely unrelated or ignores previous context.  
   - Values in between indicate partial alignment (e.g., `0.6` means some relevance but with a noticeable disconnect).

4. **logical_continuity** (float: 0.0 to 1.0)  
   - Assesses whether the logical flow is maintained.
   - `1.0`: Clear, coherent reasoning with no gaps or abrupt shifts.  
   - `0.0`: Illogical response that disrupts understanding.  
   - Values in between indicate minor inconsistencies (e.g., `0.7` means mostly logical but slightly disjointed).

5. **no_contradiction** (float: 0.0 to 1.0)  
   - Checks if the turn contradicts previous statements.
   - `1.0`: No contradictions; fully aligned with prior context.  
   - `0.0`: Directly contradicts prior statements.  
   - Values in between suggest minor inconsistencies (e.g., `0.8` means mostly consistent but with a small contradiction).

6. **coherence_score** (float: 0.0 to 1.0)  
   - A weighted aggregate of coherence metrics, reflecting **logical consistency**, **contextual relevance**, and **flow** in the conversation:
     - `1.0`: Fully coherent, all aspects align well.  
     - `0.0`: Completely incoherent, with major logical flaws.  
     - `Intermediate values (e.g., 0.5, 0.75, etc.)`: indicate varying degrees of coherence, depending on the severity and number of issues.

    #### **Scoring Interpretation**
    - **0.0 - 0.33 (Poor Coherence)**  
      - Multiple major coherence issues present.  
      - Examples:  
        - Two or more coherence factors score **below 0.5**.  
        - The response **completely ignores** previous context.  
        - **Contradicts prior statements** or introduces inconsistencies.  
        - **Logical jumps** that break conversation flow.  

    - **0.34 - 0.66 (Moderate Coherence)**  
      - Some coherence issues exist, but the response is generally understandable.  
      - Examples:  
        - One coherence factor scores **below 0.5**.  
        - Response is **partially relevant** but not perfectly aligned.  
        - **Minor topic drift**, though still connected to prior turns.  
        - Slightly abrupt transitions, but **recoverable** in conversation.  
        - **Small gaps in logical flow** that don’t severely impact understanding.  

    - **0.67 - 1.0 (High Coherence)**  
      - Strong logical flow and consistency throughout.  
      - Examples:  
        - **All or all but one coherence factors** score **above 0.75**.  
        - Response **directly addresses** the previous turn.  
        - **Topic relevance is maintained** throughout.  
        - The conversation **flows smoothly**, without unnatural jumps.  

### Instructions
1. Read the user-provided **metadata**, **script**, and **conversation** carefully.  
2. For each turn in the conversation, fill out the checklist above:
   - Fill the `turn_id` field with the index of the current turn.
   - Assign a **float value (0.0 - 1.0)** for `topic_relevance`, `contextual_follow_up`, `logical_continuity`, and `no_contradiction`.
   - Compute a **coherence_score** as a float (0.0 - 1.0) based on the qualitative coherence of the turn.
3. Return your final output as a **JSON list (array)** of length **N**, where **N** is the total number of turns.  
4. Ensure you do **not** include any additional text outside the JSON array. The result should be a valid JSON structure.
